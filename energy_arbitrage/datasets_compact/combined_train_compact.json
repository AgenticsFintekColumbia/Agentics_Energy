Determine the optimal 24-hour battery charge/discharge schedule to minimize costs.\n\nBATTERY SPECIFICATIONS:\n- Capacity: 49.44 kWh\n- Max charge/discharge power: 12.36 kW\n- Charge efficiency: 0.95\n- Discharge efficiency: 0.95\n- Round-trip efficiency: 0.9025\n- Initial SOC: 0.50\n- SOC range: [0.00, 1.00]\n\nPHYSICS & CONSTRAINTS:\nSOC evolution equation:\n  SOC[t+1] = SOC[t] + (charge[t] * 0.95 - discharge[t] / 0.95) / 49.44\n\nHard constraints (ALL must be satisfied):\n1. 0 \u2264 charge[t] \u2264 12.36 kW for all hours\n2. 0 \u2264 discharge[t] \u2264 12.36 kW for all hours  \n3. 0.0 \u2264 SOC[t] \u2264 1.0 for all hours\n4. charge[t] * discharge[t] = 0 (no simultaneous charge/discharge)\n5. SOC[0] = 0.5\n\nOPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:\n- Charge when price < 25th percentile\n- Discharge when price > 75th percentile\n- Maximize arbitrage spread (sell_price - buy_price) * efficiency\n- Respect SOC limits throughout the day\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no explanations):\n{\n  \"status\": \"optimal\",\n  \"cost\": <total_cost_eur>,\n  \"charge\": [<24 hourly values in kW>],\n  \"discharge\": [<24 hourly values in kW>],\n  \"soc\": [<25 values from hour 0 to 24>],\n  \"reasoning\": \"<brief 1-2 sentence strategy summary>\"\n}",
